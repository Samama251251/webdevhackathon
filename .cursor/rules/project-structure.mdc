# Project Context & Architecture

You are working on a React project (frontend) that connects to a backend/Supabase.

The project follows a strict feature-based directory structure.

# Directory Structure Rules

## 1. Services & API (Supabase)

- **Rule:** ALL external data fetching and Supabase interactions must reside in `src/services`.

- **Constraint:** UI components (`src/components` or `src/pages`) must NEVER import `@supabase/supabase-js` directly.

- **Pattern:** Components should import helper functions from `src/services` to fetch or mutate data.

## 2. Component Organization

- **Rule:** Components must be organized by domain or page, not flat in the directory.

- **Specific Components:** If a component is specific to a page (e.g., the Landing page), it must go into a matching folder inside components (e.g., `src/components/Landing/HeroSection.tsx`).

- **Shared Components:** Generic UI elements used across multiple pages (buttons, inputs, cards) must go in `src/components/common`.

- **Layouts:** Global wrappers go in `src/components/layout`.

## 3. General Folder Roles

- `src/pages`: Route entry points only. Keep logic minimal here; delegate to components/hooks.

- `src/hooks`: Custom React hooks (e.g., `useAuth`, `useFetch`).

- `src/contexts`: React Context definitions (Global state).

- `src/types`: TypeScript interfaces and type definitions. **ALL types must be defined in this folder. Never define types inline in components, services, or other files.**

- `src/lib`: External library configurations (e.g., Supabase client initialization, Axios instances).

# Coding Style Guidelines

- **Naming:** Use PascalCase for components (e.g., `JobCard.tsx`) and camelCase for functions/hooks (e.g., `useJobData.ts`).

- **Imports:** Use absolute imports where configured (e.g., `@/components/common/Button`) to avoid `../../` hell.

- **Strict Mode:** Ensure all Supabase service calls are typed correctly using the types in `src/types`.

- **Types:** ALL TypeScript interfaces, types, and type definitions MUST be placed in `src/types`. Never define types inline in component files, service files, or any other location. Import types from `src/types` when needed.

- **Collaboration:** Use clear naming and comments to help teammates understand your code quickly.

- **Debugging:** Log key actions and errors to the console for faster troubleshooting.
